Building with responsive desing.

Microverse Project 2: Building with responsive desing. 

This project helps us understand a way of create a web page called "Responsive Design",
utilizing media querys, and all the concepts that we learned about HTML and CSS like
flexbox, float and grid. So using Responsive Design we may be able to change the
size of the window and our web page may response to that re-sizing the elements.
