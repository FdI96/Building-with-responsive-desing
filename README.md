Positioning and Floating Elements

Microverse Project 1: Recreate the New York Times Article. 

This project helps us understand a way of create a web page called "Responsive Design", utilizing media querys, and all the concepts that we learned about HTML and CSS
like flexbox, float and grid. So using Responsive Design we may be able to change the size of the window and our web page may response to that re-sizing the elements.
